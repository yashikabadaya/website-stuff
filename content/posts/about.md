### Biography:

  Duffie is a Staff Cloud Native Architect at VMware focused on helping enterprises find success with technologies like Kubernetes. Duffie has been working with all things virtualization and networking for 20 years and remembers most of it. He likes to present on topics ranging from How do I solve this problem with Kubernetes to What even is a CNI implementation and which one should I choose?. A student of perspective, Duffie is always interested in working through problems and design choices from more than one perspective.
